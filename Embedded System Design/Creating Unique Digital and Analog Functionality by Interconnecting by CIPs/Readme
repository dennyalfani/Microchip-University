This class will show how to create a FSK demodulator, high-resolution PWM, WS2812B RGB LED protocol, ultrasonic range detector, metal detector, AC Sine direct drive and switch-mode power supply by interconnecting multiple Core Independent Peripherals (CIPs). Examples will be shown using PICÂ® and SAM MCUs. The CIP interconnections and circuit wave-forms will be presented along with live demonstrations of several of these designs. Exposure to these real-world examples will help you to apply CIPs in your project to reduce component count and improve system performance by replacing firmware overhead with CIP hardware.
